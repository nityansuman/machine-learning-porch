## Embeddings

In the context, embeddings are low-dimensional, learned continuous vector representations of discrete variables.
An embedding is a mapping of a discrete — categorical — variable to a vector of continuous numbers.
Word embedding is a term used for the representation of words for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning

## Text Classification

Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups.

- [IMDb Moview Review Sentiment Classification](imdb-movie-review-classification.ipynb) - Implemented a stacked bi-directional LSTM architecture which learns embeddings from scratch and classifies movie reviews into positive and negative sentiments with an accuracy of over 85% on out of sample test dataset.
