## Welcome

Here you will find some of my AI based solution notebooks for Anaytics, Natural Language Processing, Time Series, Computer Vision and everything in between.

### Analytics

- [Churn Prediction Through Usage Analysis](analytics/)
- [Credit Card Fraudulent Transaction Detection](analytics/)

### Natural Language Processing

- [Word2Vec Embeddings - Skip Gram Model Using Negative Sampling](natural-language/)
- [Training Embeddings From Scratch Or Use Pre-trained Embeddings](natural-language/)
- [IMDb Moview Review Sentiment Classification](natural-language/)

### Computer Vision

### TensorFlow 2 API

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming.
