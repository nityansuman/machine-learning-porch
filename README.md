Artificial intelligence, sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.

In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.

### Welcome to my GitHub repository

Here you will find some of my machine Learning based solution notebooks for Natural Language Processing & Understanding, Time Series, Computer Vision and everything in between.

## Analytics

### Churn Detection

Churn quantifies the number of customers who have left the brand by cancelling their subscription or stop paying for services. This is bad news for any business as it costs five times as much to attract a new customer as it does to keep an existing one.

A high customer churn rate will hit any company’s finances hard. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning (ML), one can anticipate potential churners.

- [Churn Prediction Through Usage Analysis](analytics/churn-prediction-through-usage-analysis.ipynb) - The bagging ensemble model (Random Forest) detects 77% (recall on test set) of the leavers which is a good performance considering our objective is to detect leavers.

### Credit Fraud Detection

- [Credit Card Fraud Transaction Detection](analytics/credit-fraud-detection.ipynb) - The bagging ensemble model (Random Forest) was able to achieve 100% (recall on test) of the fraud transactions with almost 0 FPR (false positve rate) on a very highly imbalanced dataset (where only 0.172% transactions where fraudulant) using SMOTE and weighted objective technique.

## Natural Language

### Embeddings

In the context, embeddings are low-dimensional, learned continuous vector representations of discrete variables.
An embedding is a mapping of a discrete — categorical — variable to a vector of continuous numbers.
Word embedding is a term used for the representation of words for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning

- [Training Embeddings From Scratch Or Use Pre-trained Embeddings](natural-language/embeddings-playground.ipynb)

### Text Classification

Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups.

- [IMDb Moview Review Classification](natural-language/imdb-movie-review-classification.ipynb) - Model uses a stacked bi-directional LSTM architecture to classify reviews into `positive` and `negative` classes with an accuracy of over 85% on out of sample test dataset.

<!-- ### Time Series

A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.

- [Sales Forecasting](time-series/)

### Structured Data

Predictive analytics is the branch of the advanced analytics which is used to make predictions about unknown events using tabulated data points.

- [Customer Lifetime Value Prediction](structured-data/) -->

## Computer Vision

### Image Classification

Image classification (a.k.a. image categorization) is the task of assigning a set of predefined categories/labels to a groups of pixels or an image.

`Model Architecture` implementations:

- [AlexNet Model Architecture Implementation](computer-vision/alex_net.py)

## TensorFlow 2 API

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming.
