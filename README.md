### Customer Churn Prediction Through Usage Analysis

Churn quantifies the number of customers who have left the brand by cancelling their subscription or stop paying for services. This is bad news for any business as it costs five times as much to attract a new customer as it does to keep an existing one.

A high customer churn rate will hit any companyâ€™s finances hard. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning (ML), one can anticipate potential churners.

- [Notebook](churn-prediction-through-usage-analysis.ipynb) - The bagging based ensemble model (Random Forest) was able to detect 77% (recall on test set) of the churners with an accuracy of above 70% on an imbalanced dataset using random over-sampling, which is a good performance considering our objective is to detect churners.

### Credit Card Fraudulent Transaction Detection

Fraud detection is a set of processes and analyses that allow businesses to identify and prevent unauthorized financial activity. This can include fraudulent credit card transactions, identify theft, cyber hacking, insurance scams, and more. Companies can incorporate fraud detection into their websites, company policies, employee training, and enhanced security features. The most effective companies combat fraud by using a multifaceted approach that integrates several of these techniques.

- [Notebook](credit-fraud-detection.ipynb) - The bagging based ensemble model (Random Forest) was able to identify 100% (recall on test) of the fraud transactions with only 9 instances of FPR (false positive rate) on a very highly imbalanced dataset (where only 0.172% transactions where fraudulent) using SMOTE and weighted objective function.
