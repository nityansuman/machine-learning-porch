# Awesome AI

Artificial intelligence, sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.

In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.

## Codebase

### Natural Language Understanding

Text classification (a.k.a. text categorization or text tagging) is the task of assigning a set of predefined categories to an open-ended text.

An embedding is a mapping of a discrete — categorical — variable to a vector of continuous numbers. In the context of neural networks, embeddings are low-dimensional, learned continuous vector representations of discrete variables.

### Time Series

A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.

### Structured Data

Predictive analytics is the branch of the advanced analytics which is used to make predictions about unknown events using tabulated data points.

- [Customer Lifetime Value Prediction](structured-data/) -->

### Computer Vision

Image classification (a.k.a. image categorization) is the task of assigning a set of predefined categories/labels to a groups of pixels or an image.

### TensorFlow 2 API

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming.
